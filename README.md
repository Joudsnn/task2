# HTML Foundations: Milestone 2 — Anchor Tags, Images & Lists

## 🚀 Overview
This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in HTML. In this milestone, I focused on practicing three core elements of web development:

- Anchor elements (`<a>`)
- Image elements (`<img>`)
- List elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)

The project involves creating a simple and clean HTML page that demonstrates how these elements can be used effectively in a real-world scenario.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to create clickable links to internal and external websites using `<a>` tags
- How to include and format images from both local files and URLs
- How to organize content using ordered and unordered lists

## 🌐 How to View
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

## 📅 Milestone Info
- **Level:** Beginner
- **Focus:** Practice and reinforcement
- **Tools Used:** Basic HTML, local files

## 📝 My Notes
- Lists in HTML:
  In HTML, there are two main types of lists used to organize content:
  **Ordered Lists:** Used when the order of items matters, such as steps in a process or ranked information. Items are automatically numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3... or a, b, c... depending on the type attribute).
  **Unordered Lists:** Used when the order of items is not important. Items are displayed with bullet points by default.
  Each item within a list is defined using the list item tag. Always wrap list content inside list item tags to ensure proper structure and formatting.

- Anchor Elemets in HTML:
  Anchor elements are used to create hyperlinks — clickable text or images that take the user to another page or resource.
  The basic syntax uses the href attribute to specify the destination URL.
  To make the link open in a new tab, add the target="_blank" attribute; this keeps your current page open while the link opens in a separate tab.

- Image Elements in HTML:
  To display an image in HTML, use the image tag. This is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't need a closing tag.
  src specifies the source of the image. This can be a URL or a local file path (either relative or absolute).
  alt provides alternative text, which describes the image. This is helpful for screen readers and displays if the image can't load.
  width and height can be used to control the image’s dimensions.
